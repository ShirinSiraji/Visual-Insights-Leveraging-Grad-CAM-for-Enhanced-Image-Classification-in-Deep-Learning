This project aims to develop a deep learning model using PyTorch to classify images of different types of vegetables (cucumber, eggplant, and mushroom). Additionally, it utilizes Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) to visualize the specific regions within the image that the model focuses on for its predictions. This visualization technique enhances model interpretability, making it easier to understand the reasoning behind the model's decisions.
